ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

Welcome to Zephyr, the AI-powered event management bot for Discord, exclusively designed for [TruckersMP](https://truckersmp.com/) events. Our goal is to make managing events on this platform easy, stress-free, and enjoyable! 

With our advanced AI technology, we can detect event tickets and even make some event decisions for you. We rely heavily on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) technology to power our operations and decision-making processes.

Our key aim is to use AI and other tools to ease the burden on event managers, whether they're VTCs or members who play on the platform. We're highly customisable, so you can tailor our features to work in a way that suits you and your server. Whether you're running a small gathering or organising a large-scale event, we've got you covered. ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰

It's important to note that we're still in the early stages of development and may not be ready for servers just yet. However, we're working hard to improve and bring you the best experience possible. 

If you have any questions, comments, or want to learn more about us, feel free to reach out! We'd love to hear from you. ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬
