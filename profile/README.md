# 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to Zephyr, the AI-powered event management bot for Discord, exclusively designed for [TruckersMP](https://truckersmp.com/) events. Our goal is to make managing events on this platform easy, stress-free, and enjoyable! 

## Our features
- Detection of event tickets using AI technology 🎫
- Partial AI decision-making to streamline event management 🤖
- Customizable variables to tailor our functionality to your needs 🛠️
- Manual intervention to ensure balanced decision-making 🙋‍♂️
- Highly customisable to suit servers of all sizes 🚀🎉


## About us
With our advanced AI technology, we can detect event tickets and even make some event decisions for you. We rely heavily on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) technology to power our operations and decision-making processes.

Our key aim is to use AI and other tools to ease the burden on event managers, whether they're VTCs or members who play on the platform. Whether you're running a small gathering or organising a large-scale event, we've got you covered.

It's important to note that we're still in the early stages of development and may not be ready for servers just yet. However, we're working hard to improve and bring you the best experience possible. 

## Getting started with Zephyr
To start using Zephyr, simply invite our bot to your Discord server and run the `/setup` command. This command will walk you through the initial setup procedure, where you can customize the bot to suit your server. 

Within the setup process, you'll be asked to define certain variables and will be sent drop-down menus with choices. Customisable variables include:
- Where event tickets will be opened (which category)
- Which level of management you want (fully automatic, balanced, or manual)
